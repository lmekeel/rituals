Unlike routines, rituals are characterized by intentionality and serve as a means of resistance against the mindless habits of daily life. As Kate Southworth, a London-based artist, suggests, rituals encompass various forms such as artistic processes, meditations, communal celebrations, or simple acts of observation. The framing of intention is as crucial as its enactment in rituals, allowing individuals to break free from the rational mind of habit and routine ([source](https://www.vox.com/even-better/23144784/why-rituals-not-routine)).

## About
Rituals is an iOS app built using the SwiftUI framework. It serves as a productivity tool designed to help users create and track their rituals. From a technical standpoint, Rituals follows an MVVM architecture and utilizes CoreData singleton instance for managing the persistent store of user data. Users have the option to create a full account, enabling data synchronization across devices through Firebase authentication, storage, and database services. Additionally, users can share their rituals on an explore page where they can also browse and save rituals shared by others. The app also features motivational quotes on the home page sourced from the ZenQuotes REST API.
